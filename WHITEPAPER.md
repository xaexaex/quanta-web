## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Quantum Threat

Current blockchain systems rely on elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, EdDSA) for transaction signing. These algorithms are vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, which can be efficiently executed on sufficiently powerful quantum computers. Conservative estimates suggest that quantum computers capable of breaking 256-bit ECDSA could exist within 10–15 years. Over $1.7 trillion in crypto assets rely on ECDSA today — none of them are quantum-safe.

### 1.2 Why Now?

- **NIST PQC Standards Finalized (2024)**: The cryptographic primitives are mature, peer-reviewed, and NIST-standardized
- **Migration Window is Closing**: Upgrading existing chains requires hard forks affecting millions of users; building correctly from day one eliminates this risk
- **Future-Proofing**: Infrastructure decisions made in 2026 will persist for decades. "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" attacks are already feasible — adversaries can record transactions today for decryption on future quantum hardware
- **Institutional Demand**: Global PQC market projected at $29.95B by 2034 (37.72% CAGR) — institutional capital is actively seeking exposure

### 1.3 Design Philosophy

QUANTA is built on three core principles:

1. **Quantum Resistance First**: Security against both classical and quantum adversaries from block #0 — Falcon-512 for signatures, Kyber-1024 for encryption, SHA3-256 for hashing
2. **Economic Sustainability**: Tokenomics that align incentives for long-term network health — deflationary fee burn, anti-dump vesting, perpetual mining floor
3. **Operational Excellence**: Production-ready security, high-throughput performance, comprehensive monitoring, and operational tooling written entirely in Rust

## 2. Cryptographic Foundations

### 2.1 Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

QUANTA implements NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms as consensus-critical primitives:

#### Falcon-512 (Digital Signatures)
- **Type**: Lattice-based signature scheme (NTRU lattices)
- **Security Level**: NIST Level 1 (equivalent to AES-128 classical; 64-bit post-quantum via Grover)
- **Key Sizes**:
  - Public key: **897 bytes** (exact; consensus-enforced)
  - Secret key: ~1,281 bytes (never sent to network)
  - Signature: up to **666 bytes** (variable-length compressed; signed-message blob 33–698 bytes)
- **Performance**: ~0.8 ms signing, ~0.1 ms verification (pre-quantum hardware)
- **Rationale**: Optimal balance of security, size, and speed for high-throughput blockchain use. Compact signatures (vs. Dilithium's 2,420 bytes) minimize block size pressure

#### Kyber-1024 (Key Encapsulation)
- **Type**: Module-LWE-based key encapsulation mechanism (ML-KEM)
- **Security Level**: NIST Level 5 (equivalent to AES-256)
- **Key Sizes**:
  - Public key: 1,568 bytes
  - Secret key: 3,168 bytes
- **Use Case**: Wallet encryption, secure key storage, HD wallet seed protection
- **Rationale**: Maximum security for long-term key protection in wallet files

#### SHA3-256 (Hashing)
- **Type**: Keccak-based cryptographic hash function
- **Security**: 256-bit collision resistance; quantum-safe (Grover's halves to 128-bit effective — still secure)
- **Use**: Block hashing (double-SHA3-256), transaction hashing, address derivation, signing hash

#### Argon2id (Key Derivation)
- **Type**: Memory-hard password hashing
- **Configuration**: Time cost 2, Memory 65,536 KB, Parallelism 4
- **Rationale**: Resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks, quantum-safe (memory hardness is algorithm-independent)

### 2.2 Security Analysis

**Classical Attack Resistance**:
- Signature forgery: Computationally infeasible (2^128 operations for Falcon-512)
- Hash collisions: 2^256 operations for SHA3-256 (double-SHA3 blocks add a second layer)
- Brute force: Protected by Argon2id memory hardness (~4 GB RAM required per attempt)

**Quantum Attack Resistance**:
- Grover's algorithm: Effective key security halved — Falcon-512 retains 64-bit quantum security (safe until cryptanalysis improves significantly)
- Shor's algorithm: **Not applicable** to lattice-based cryptography. Shor's targets discrete log and factoring problems; Falcon is based on NTRU lattices
- Post-quantum cryptanalysis: No known polynomial-time attacks on Falcon or Kyber as of 2026

### 2.3 Canonical Signing Contract

All transaction signatures follow a strict canonical form enforced at the protocol level. This is a **consensus-frozen** specification — any deviation results in an invalid transaction.

```
signing_bytes = sender_utf8 
             || recipient_utf8
             || amount_le64
             || timestamp_le64
             || fee_le64
             || nonce_le64
             || public_key_bytes
             || sig_scheme_u8
             || tx_type_discriminant [|| tx_type_payload]

signing_hash  = SHA3-256("QUANTA_TX_V1:" || signing_bytes)

Signature     = Falcon-512.Sign(secret_key, signing_hash)
Verification  = Falcon-512.Verify(public_key, signature, signing_hash)
```

The domain prefix `"QUANTA_TX_V1:"` is prepended before hashing. This **domain separation** ensures that a signature produced for a QUANTA transaction cannot be replayed in any other protocol or context. The `sig_scheme` byte is included in the signing payload, preventing scheme substitution attacks (an attacker cannot swap the scheme byte after signing).

### 2.4 Crypto Agility

Every transaction encodes its signature scheme as a frozen byte field:

```
SignatureScheme:
  0 = Falcon512   (current, active — all nodes verify)
  1 = Reserved    (rejected by all current nodes; activatable via soft fork)
```

This field is part of the signing payload. Future post-quantum algorithms can be activated via soft fork by assigning new scheme values and updating node verification dispatch — **no structural changes** to the transaction format are required. This ensures the protocol can adapt to cryptographic advances without hard forks.

### 2.5 Falcon-512 Protocol Hardening (5 Measures)

Five specific hardening measures ensure Falcon-512 is deployed safely in a consensus-critical environment:

**1. Separation of Signing and Verification**

Signing (which uses floating-point Gaussian sampling internally) only ever occurs in wallets. Consensus nodes — validating node, mining node — only ever call the deterministic verification path. No keypair material is required or loaded on a validating or mining node.

**2. Domain-Separated Canonical Signing Format**

Transactions are signed over `SHA3-256("QUANTA_TX_V1:" || signing_bytes)`. The domain prefix is a consensus-frozen constant. Its inclusion ensures a QUANTA signature cannot be re-used in any other protocol context.

**3. Strict Pre-Verification Size Checks**

Before any polynomial arithmetic is invoked, the verifier checks:
- `public_key.len() == 897` (exact)
- `signed_msg.len()` ∈ `[33, 698]`
- Sender address must derive from supplied public key: `"0x" || hex(SHA3-256(pubkey)[:20])`
- Signature scheme must be `Falcon512 = 0`

Malformed inputs are rejected immediately, before entering Falcon internals. This ensures protocol invariant violations are caught at constant-time cost.

**4. Crypto Agility via `sig_scheme` Field**

Every transaction includes a `sig_scheme` byte covered by the signature. Enables soft-fork algorithm upgrades.

**5. Build Determinism**

The `pqcrypto-falcon` dependency is pinned to `= 0.3.0` (exact version). The `.cargo/config.toml` sets `target-feature=+strict-float` to enforce IEEE 754 compliant floating-point behavior, preventing compiler-introduced rounding divergence between x86_64 and ARM64 consensus nodes. Release builds set `codegen-units = 1` and `incremental = false` for byte-for-byte reproducible binaries.

### 2.6 Operational Impact of Post-Quantum Cryptography

**Signature Size Implications**:
- Falcon-512 signatures (~666 bytes) are 10.4× larger than ECDSA signatures (~64 bytes)
- Actual Falcon-512 transaction size: ~1,713 bytes (666 sig + 897 pubkey + payload overhead)
- Maximum block transactions corrected to **1,200** (not 2,000): 1,200 × 1,713 B = 2.06 MB ≤ 2 MB limit

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Signature generation: ~0.8 ms
- Signature verification: ~0.1 ms (single-threaded)
- Block validation (1,200 tx, 8 cores, parallel): ~225 ms
- Block validation (1,200 tx, cache hits): ~0 ms (100k-entry LRU cache)

**Mitigation Strategies (Implemented)**:
1. **Parallel Signature Verification** (Rayon): Serial 1,800 ms → 225 ms on 8 cores
2. **LRU Signature Cache**: 100,000 entries, ~80% hit rate in practice (transactions propagate multiple times before block inclusion)
3. **zstd Compression**: Block 2 MB → ~500 KB on wire (4× reduction)
4. **Bincode Serialization**: 22% smaller than JSON, 8× faster

## 4. Consensus Mechanism

### 4.1 Adaptive Proof-of-Work

QUANTA uses a modified proof-of-work consensus with dynamic difficulty adjustment. Mining is CPU-friendly (no ASIC-optimized hash function) using SHA3 (Keccak), which has no known hardware optimization advantage.

#### Mining Algorithm
```
Block Hash = SHA3-256(SHA3-256(block_data || nonce))
Valid Block: Hash starts with `difficulty` leading zero nibbles
```

Double-SHA3 provides a two-layer pre-image resistance barrier and eliminates length-extension attacks present in SHA-2 based double-hash constructions.

#### Difficulty Adjustment
- **Interval**: Every **2,016 blocks** (~5.6 hours at 10-second average)
  - *Why 2,016?* Security fix from original design (was 10 blocks). 2,016 prevents rapid oscillation — matches Bitcoin's proven stability window.
- **Target Block Time**: 30 seconds
- **Formula (pure integer math — no floats)**:
  ```
  scaled = round(current_difficulty × expected_time / actual_time)
  
  Where:
    expected_time = 2,016 blocks × 30 seconds = 60,480 seconds
    actual_time   = median_time_past(latest_block) - median_time_past(2016_blocks_ago)
    # Median-Time-Past (MTP) prevents timestamp manipulation attacks
  ```
- **Bounds** (integer percentages):
  - Maximum increase: ×1.15 per adjustment (15% cap — prevents rapid difficulty spikes)
  - Maximum decrease: ×0.85 per adjustment (15% floor — prevents hash-rate collapse death spiral)
  - Minimum difficulty: 4
  - Maximum difficulty: 2,147,483,647 (2^31−1, supports massive hashrate growth for decades)

### 4.2 Block Structure

```rust
Block {
    index:         u64,          // Block height (monotonically increasing)
    timestamp:     i64,          // Unix timestamp (seconds)
    transactions:  Vec<Tx>,      // Up to 1,200 transactions (2 MB limit with Falcon-512)
    previous_hash: String,       // SHA3-256 hash of prior block (chain linking)
    merkle_root:   String,       // SHA3-256 Merkle root of all transaction hashes
    nonce:         u64,          // Proof-of-work nonce
    difficulty:    u32,          // Leading-zero difficulty target
    hash:          String        // double-SHA3-256 of block header fields
}
```

**Genesis Block Parameters (Mainnet — Consensus-Critical)**:
- Timestamp: `1735689600` (2026-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
- Difficulty: `6`
- Hash: `527a8a6ad3292c9b42c40f3d71fd3b89cdd79415106ce0b8d9f7f6690a96433d`

The genesis hash is hardcoded in `blockchain.rs`. Any mismatch immediately panics the node, preventing accidental cross-network contamination.

### 4.3 Transaction Types

QUANTA supports two extremely strict transaction types, both signed with Falcon-512:

```rust
TransactionType {
    Transfer,
    // Standard value transfer between two accounts

    TimeLockTransfer { unlock_height: u64 },
    // Cryptographic Escrow/Vaulting
    // Locks funds on the recipient's account until a specific block height
}
```

By explicitly rejecting Turing-complete smart contracts, QUANTA eliminates the risk of re-entrancy attacks, logic bugs, and platform-level exploits that cost the industry billions annually.

### 4.4 Transaction Structure

```rust
Transaction {
    sender:     String,       // Address: "0x" + hex(SHA3-256(pubkey)[:20])
    recipient:  String,       // Recipient address (empty for DeployContract)
    amount:     u64,          // Amount in microunits (1 QUA = 1,000,000 microunits)
    fee:        u64,          // Transaction fee in microunits (min: 100)
    nonce:      u64,          // Monotonic account nonce (replay prevention)
    timestamp:  i64,          // Creation time; rejected if > 24 hours old
    signature:  Vec<u8>,      // Falcon-512 signed-message blob (33–698 bytes)
    public_key: Vec<u8>,      // Falcon-512 public key (must be exactly 897 bytes)
    sig_scheme: u8,           // Signature scheme: 0=Falcon512, 1=Reserved
    tx_type:    TransactionType
}
```

**Account Model**: QUANTA uses an **account-based model** (not UTXO). Each address has:
- `balance`: spendable microunits
- `nonce`: monotonically increasing counter (starts at 0, first tx uses nonce 1)
- `locked_balances`: list of `(amount, unlock_height)` pairs — coinbase maturity + mining vesting

### 4.5 Transaction Validation (Ordered Rules)

Each transaction must satisfy all checks in order:

1. **Signature scheme known**: `sig_scheme == 0` (Falcon512). Unknown values rejected.
2. **Non-empty fields**: Both `signature` and `public_key` must be non-empty.
3. **Public key length**: Exactly 897 bytes — checked before any crypto operations.
4. **Signed message length**: In range `[33, 698]` — checked before any crypto operations.
5. **Sender derives from public key**: `"0x" + hex(SHA3-256(pubkey)[:20])` must equal `sender`.
6. **Cryptographic verification**: `Falcon-512.Verify(pubkey, signature, SHA3-256("QUANTA_TX_V1:" || signing_bytes))` must succeed.
7. **Balance check**: `spendable_balance >= amount + fee`.
8. **Nonce ordering**: `tx.nonce == account_nonce + 1` (atomic — DashMap prevents race conditions).
9. **Timestamp validity**: `tx.timestamp >= now - 86400` (24-hour expiry window).
10. **Fee minimum**: `fee >= 100` microunits (0.0001 QUA).
11. **No duplicates**: `tx.hash()` not already in mempool or recent blocks.
12. **Size limit**: Serialized tx ≤ 100 KB (100,000 bytes; DoS protection).

### 4.6 Block Validation

Each block must satisfy:
1. **Proof-of-Work**: `hash.starts_with("0" × difficulty)` using double-SHA3-256
2. **Merkle Root**: `merkle_root == SHA3-256_merkle_tree(transaction_hashes)`
3. **Previous Hash**: Correctly references parent block hash
4. **Timestamp**: `prev.timestamp < block.timestamp <= now + 7200` (within 2 hours of current time)
5. **Transaction Validity**: All transactions individually valid (parallel Falcon-512 verification + nonce/balance state validation)
6. **Coinbase Correctness**: Exactly one `COINBASE` sender tx; amount must equal `immediate_reward + fee_to_miner`
7. **Treasury Correctness**: Treasury tx must exist when `treasury_amount > 0`; must send to `ms69216b1d10425689704d5ae3b2a4aa17049f59b1` (3-of-5 Falcon-512 multisig, hardcoded consensus constant)
8. **Block Size**: Serialized ≤ 2,097,152 bytes (2 MB)
9. **Transaction Count**: ≤ 1,200 transactions
10. **Difficulty**: Must equal `calculate_next_difficulty()` exactly
11. **Checkpoint**: Must match hardcoded checkpoint hash at checkpoint heights

### 4.7 PQC Performance Optimizations

**Parallel Signature Verification (Rayon — physical core tuning)**:
```
Serial:          1,200 tx × 1.5 ms = 1,800 ms
Parallel:        1,200 tx × 1.5 ms ÷ physical_cores = ~225 ms  ← 8× speedup
Thread pool:     num_cpus::get_physical() (not logical — HT adds no benefit for Falcon crypto)
```

**Signature Verification Cache (LRU)**:
```
Cache size:  100,000 entries
Hit rate:    ~80% (transactions seen multiple times before block inclusion)
Cache hit:   0 ms  ← instant verification
Effective block validation time: ~45 ms at 80% cache
```

**Bloom Filter Mempool Deduplication (NEW)**:
```
Before: O(n) scan — 1,200 txs × 1,713 bytes = 2 MB iteration per add
After:  O(1) probabilistic — Bloom::new_for_fp_rate(50_000, 0.0001)
False-positive rate: 0.01% — confirmed by hash-compare on positive hit
```

**Pubkey Deserialization Cache (NEW)**:
```
Problem: Falcon-512 pubkey = 897 bytes, re-deserialized N times for N txs from same sender
Solution: DashMap<sender_address, pubkey_bytes> — lock-free concurrent reads
Bonus: detects key-substitution attacks (mismatch = instant reject with warn log)
```

**Block Compression (zstd)**:
```
Uncompressed block:  ~2 MB
Compressed block:    ~500 KB  ← 4× reduction
Network daily data:  ~13 GB → ~3.25 GB
```

**Throughput**:
- **40 TPS** (1,200 tx ÷ 30 seconds)
- 17× higher than Bitcoin (~7 TPS)
- 8× higher than Ethereum PoW (~15 TPS)
- Achieved despite 10.4× larger signatures than ECDSA

## 5. Economic Model

See [TOKENOMICS.md](./TOKENOMICS.md) for the complete economic specification.

### 5.1 Supply Overview

- **Initial Supply**: 0 QUA (fair launch — no pre-mine, no ICO, no team allocation)
- **Emission Schedule**: Exponential decay (15% annual reduction) with a 5 QUA perpetual floor
- **Soft Maximum**: ~1.5 billion QUA by year 15–20
- **Distribution**: 100% through proof-of-work mining

### 5.2 Block Reward Formula (Integer Math — Consensus Critical)

```
year = block_height / 1,051,200    (integer division)
base  = 100 QUA × (85/100)^year   (applied iteratively using integer ops)
reward = max(base, 5 QUA)

No floating point — integer division only, to prevent consensus forks
across x86_64 and ARM64 architectures.
```

### 5.3 Reward Distribution Per Block

```
Block Reward = R  (e.g., 100 QUA in Year 1)

Treasury allocation:  R × 5%  → ms69216b1d10425689704d5ae3b2a4aa17049f59b1 (3-of-5 multisig)
Miner reward:         R × 95% → Miner address

  Of miner reward:
    Immediate:  (R × 95%) × 50% = 47.5% of R  (spendable now)
    Locked:     (R × 95%) × 50% = 47.5% of R  (locked for 52,560 blocks / ~6 months)
```

### 5.4 Fee Distribution Per Block

```
Total fees = sum of all tx.fee in block

Fee burn:      fees × 70%  → Destroyed (deflationary)
Fee treasury:  fees × 20%  → Treasury address
Fee miner:     fees × 10%  → Miner address (added to coinbase)
```

| Transactions | `NewTx`, `GetMempool`, `Mempool` |
| Maintenance | `Ping`, `Pong`, `Disconnect` |

**Security Parameters**:
- Maximum message size: 2 MB (DoS protection)
- Maximum peers: 125 connections
- Ping interval: 60 seconds
- Peer timeout: 180 seconds (3 pings missed)
- Wire encoding: bincode (binary, not JSON — 8× faster, 22% smaller than text)

### 6.2 DNS Seed Discovery

Nodes bootstrap peer discovery through DNS seeds:
```
seed.quanta.network
nodes.quanta.network
peers.quanta.network
```

Falls back to hardcoded bootstrap addresses if DNS is unavailable. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS resolution.

### 6.3 Block Propagation

1. Miner mines valid block
2. Broadcasts to all connected peers (bincode-encoded, zstd-compressed)
3. Peers validate (parallel signature verification + LRU cache)
4. Peers rebroadcast to their connections
5. Full network propagation target: **< 5 seconds**

### 6.4 Blockchain Sync Protocol

On first start, a new node:
1. Connects to bootstrap peers
2. Requests chain height
3. Downloads missing blocks sequentially (with parallel validation)
4. Verifies every block including Merkle root, signatures, reward amounts
5. Begins participating in block propagation and mempool relay

Initial sync speed: limited by bandwidth (~500 KB/block compressed) and CPU (225 ms/block validation).

### 6.5 Mempool Management

- **Maximum size**: 5,000 pending transactions
- **Eviction policy**: Lowest-fee transactions evicted when full
- **Priority ordering**: Highest fee-per-transaction selected first for block template
- **Expiry**: Transactions older than 24 hours automatically evicted
- **Nonce tracking**: Per-sender `DashMap<String, u64>` for atomic concurrent nonce validation (eliminates race conditions)
- **Duplicate detection**: Transaction hash deduplication before mempool insertion

## 7. Security Analysis

### 7.1 Threat Model

**Assumptions**:
- Adversary has bounded classical computational power
- Adversary does not control > 50% of mining power
- Adversary may operate sybil network nodes
- Adversary may possess quantum computers with up to 10^6 qubits in the future

**Explicitly NOT Protected Against**:
- 51% attacks (fundamental PoW property)
- Eclipse attacks on network-isolated nodes (mitigated by diverse bootstrapping)
- Physical key extraction from compromised devices

### 7.2 Attack Resistance

#### Double-Spend Attack
**Mitigation**:
- Recommended confirmation depth: 6 blocks for high-value transactions
- Probabilistic finality: 99.9% certainty after 6 blocks even at 40% attacker hashpower
- Checkpoint system: prevents rewriting finalized checkpoints

#### Transaction Replay Attack
**Mitigation**:
- Monotonic nonce per account (stored in persistent account state)
- 24-hour transaction expiry window
- Unique transaction hash (covers all fields including nonce and timestamp)

#### Timestamp Manipulation
**Mitigation**:
- Block timestamp must be strictly > previous block timestamp
- Block timestamp must be ≤ now + 7,200 seconds (±2 hours tolerance)
- Difficulty adjustment uses **Median-Time-Past** across last 11 blocks, not raw timestamps

#### Memory Exhaustion / DoS
**Mitigation**:
- Orphan block limit: 100 blocks maximum
- Mempool cap: 5,000 transactions
- Maximum message size: 2 MB
- Maximum transaction size: 100 KB
- Strict pre-check rejection of malformed crypto inputs

#### Sybil Attack
**Mitigation**:
- Proof-of-work requirement for block production (CPU investment required)
- Maximum 125 peer connections (bounds sybil influence)
- Peer diversity through multiple DNS seed domains

### 7.3 Post-Quantum Security Considerations

**Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)**:
- **Threat**: Adversary records wallet-encrypted data today; decrypts on future quantum hardware
- **QUANTA Protection**: Kyber-1024 encryption provides 256-bit post-quantum security — safe until at least 2045 under conservative estimates

**Signature Forgery via Quantum Computer**:
- **Threat**: Future quantum computer forges Falcon-512 transaction signatures
- **QUANTA Protection**: Falcon-512 relies on NTRU lattice problems. No known quantum algorithm (Shor's or otherwise) solves lattice problems efficiently. Current best quantum attacks are brute-force (Grover's), reducing security from 128-bit to 64-bit — still computationally infeasible.

**Long-Range Chain Rewrite**:
- **Threat**: Adversary rewrites chain history from genesis
- **QUANTA Protection**: Hardcoded checkpoints in binary prevent rewriting finalized chain segments. Social consensus (exchanges, wallets reject alternative chains at checkpoint heights).

### 8.3 Storage Schema (sled Key-Value)

```
Blockchain:
  "blocks/{height}"        → bincode(Block)      ← full block
  "blocks/height"          → u64                 ← current chain height
  "blocks/hash/{hash}"     → u64                 ← height lookup by hash

Account State:
  "accounts/{addr}/balance"             → u64     ← spendable microunits
  "accounts/{addr}/nonce"               → u64     ← current account nonce
  "accounts/{addr}/locked_balances"    → bincode(Vec<LockedBalance>)

Indexes:
  "transactions/{tx_hash}" → (block_height, tx_index)
```

### 8.4 HD Wallet (BIP39 / BIP32 with Falcon-512)

QUANTA supports hierarchical deterministic wallets compatible with the BIP39 and BIP32 standards, adapted for Falcon-512 keys:

- **Mnemonic**: 24-word BIP39 phrase (256-bit entropy)
- **Master Seed**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (2048 rounds) from mnemonic + optional passphrase
- **Account Generation**: HMAC-SHA512-based child key derivation per account index
- **Key Per Account**: Each account generates a fresh Falcon-512 keypair
- **Backup**: The 24-word mnemonic is the sole recovery mechanism

```bash
# Generate HD wallet with 3 accounts
quanta new_hd_wallet --accounts 3 --file hd_wallet.json
```

### 8.5 Multisig Transactions

QUANTA implements M-of-N threshold Falcon-512 multisig for treasury and high-value accounts:

- **Scheme**: M-of-N signers must provide valid Falcon-512 signatures
- **Use Cases**: Treasury (3-of-5), team wallets, smart contract escrow
- **Address**: Multisig address derived from SHA3-256 hash of all N public keys
- **Verification**: Block validator checks M independent Falcon-512 signatures

### 8.6 REST API Endpoints

```
GET  /health                     ← Node health check
GET  /blocks/:height             ← Block by height
GET  /blocks/latest              ← Latest block
GET  /transactions/:hash         ← Transaction by hash
GET  /accounts/:address/balance  ← Account balance
GET  /accounts/:address/nonce    ← Account nonce
GET  /mempool                    ← Pending transactions
POST /transactions               ← Submit new transaction
GET  /peers                      ← Connected peer list
GET  /network/stats              ← Network statistics
```

## 9. Governance and Upgrades

See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for full governance documentation.

### 9.1 Current Governance Model (Off-Chain, Phase 1)

- Kishore K (Founder) and core team propose upgrades via GitHub Discussions
- Community review minimum 7 days open before implementation
- Testnet deployment minimum 14 days before mainnet consideration
- Mainnet consensus changes: minimum 30-day advance notice
- **Treasury**: 3-of-5 Falcon-512 multisig (`ms69216b1d10425689704d5ae3b2a4aa17049f59b1`). Any 3 of 5 keyholders must sign all treasury spends. All transactions publicly visible on-chain.

### 9.2 Soft Fork Process

Soft forks are backward-compatible upgrades:
1. New rule added with version bit signaling
2. 95% miner activation threshold
3. Old nodes remain valid (receive valid blocks)
4. Example: activating a new `sig_scheme` value

### 9.3 Hard Fork Policy

Hard forks will be:
- Announced with minimum 4-week notice
- Testnet-validated for minimum 2 weeks
- Semantically versioned (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Require explicit user upgrade action

### 9.4 PoW → PoS Transition (Planned)

The codebase includes a `ConsensusEngine` enum with `ProofOfWork` (live) and `ProofOfStake` (stub). When PoS is implemented:

```toml
# quanta.toml — future activation
consensus_engine = "proof_of_stake"
```

Planned timeline: PoW/PoS hybrid by Q1 2027, PoS primary by Q3 2027. See [GOVERNANCE.md §4](GOVERNANCE.md) for details.

### 9.5 Future On-Chain Governance (Planned Year 2+)

- Token-weighted proposal voting
- Time-locked protocol upgrade execution
- Emergency security patches with multisig override
- Transparent on-chain treasury spending proposals
- Expand treasury multisig from 3-of-5 to 5-of-9 with external contributors

---

## 12. Conclusion

Quantum computers represent an existential threat to every blockchain secured by elliptic curve cryptography. QUANTA is not a retrofitted patch — it is a blockchain designed from block #0 with NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography at its core.

With Falcon-512 signatures, Kyber-1024 wallet encryption, SHA3-256 hashing, a fair launch model, sustainable tokenomics, and a production-grade Rust implementation, QUANTA provides the infrastructure for digital value to survive the quantum era.

The window to build quantum-resistant infrastructure before quantum computers arrive is narrowing. QUANTA is already here.

## Appendix A: FAQ

**Q: What makes QUANTA different from simply adding PQ signatures to Bitcoin?**

A: Retrofitting Bitcoin would require every address holder to migrate, a coordinated hard fork of thousands of nodes, and changes to UTXO structures. QUANTA builds PQ cryptography at the protocol foundation: signing format, address derivation, wallet encryption, and node verification are all PQ-native. There is no "legacy mode" that weakens security.

**Q: Isn't Falcon-512 only NIST Level 1? Should we use Level 3 or higher?**

A: Level 1 provides 128-bit classical / 64-bit quantum security. A quantum computer capable of attacking 64-bit Falcon security would require millions of error-corrected qubits — a capability estimated to be 30+ years away under the most optimistic projections. Falcon-512 offers the best throughput for a blockchain (smaller signatures, faster verification). We can upgrade via the `sig_scheme` soft-fork mechanism if needed.

**Q: What is the `tx_type` field and why does it matter for investors?**

A: QUANTA supports two transaction types: `Transfer` and `TimeLockTransfer`. By explicitly omitting smart contracts, QUANTA guarantees that funds cannot be lost to code exploits, re-entrancy attacks, or "rug pulls". It is a true cryptographic vault. The `TimeLockTransfer` functionality provides native protocol-level escrow and vesting without relying on vulnerable third-party code.

**Q: What is the HD wallet and why does it matter?**

A: The HD wallet uses BIP39 (24-word mnemonic) and BIP32 (hierarchical deterministic derivation) with Falcon-512 keys. A single 24-word seed backs up all accounts. This provides the same user experience as any modern crypto wallet, with full post-quantum security.

**Q: Why Proof-of-Work instead of Proof-of-Stake?**

A: PoW provides Sybil resistance through physical resource expenditure, requires no initial token distribution (enabling a fair launch), and has a 15-year proven security track record. PoS systems require a pre-existing token distribution — which creates centralization. QUANTA's fair launch through PoW enables genuine decentralization from genesis.

**Q: When is mainnet?**

A: Target Q1 2027. The current phase is testnet development (Q2-Q3 2026) followed by mainnet preparation and code freeze (Q4 2026).
